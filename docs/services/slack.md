# slack

Rendering pointillism resources in 
[Slack](https://www.slack.com)
is supported.  

Preview images appear on shared links like you would expect.

`svg`s aren't supported in slack presently.  We recommend using the `png` format.

### Slack PROTIP

If you want to update a rendered URL, you can edit the link and 
throw a cache buster on there to re-render the link.  Adding a `?1` (or 2 or 3) 
to the end of the link should do the trick.
