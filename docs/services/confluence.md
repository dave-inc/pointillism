# Confluence (Atlassian)

Rendering pointillism resources on 
[Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence)
is supported.

Unfortunately, Confluence made some large updates and broke a 
lot of functionalty, or at least made it hard to get to.

This ridiculous process is the most straight forward way for you 
to render graphs in confluence.

## Confluence Workaround

You'll be copy/pasting in a Markdown image into confluence.

1. Take your pointillism url and make it into a markdown image::

   `![pointillism image](https://pointillism.io/trevorgrayson/pointillism/master/example.dot.svg)`

2. You need to remove rich text formatting from it.  If you have a basic browser, you may get to skip the next step.
3. Paste your image text into a non rich-text text area (your browser's URL bar or a terminal will work.)
4. Copy the text out again.
5. Paste this into Confluence where you would like it.
