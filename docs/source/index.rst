This documentation is in an early state, visit `pointillism.io <https://pointillism.io>`_ to get started.

`pointillism` works with virtually all the services you use.
`Just-In-Time` rendered diagrams won't get out-dated.

* wikis (`MediaWiki <https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki>`_, \
  `Confluence <./services/confluence.html>`_, ...)

Technologies
